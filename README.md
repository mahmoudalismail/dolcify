# Dolcify
Protocol Code 39 - Making the perfect Dolce Gusto drink!

# About

This protocol (code 39) has been developed by **Mahmoud Alismail** and
**Hasan AlJawaheri** at our office. Code 39 took significant amount
of time and resources to develop. We worked very hard to bring you this
protocol. We sincerely hope you enjoy it and adopt it in
your office!

# Code 39

In the `protocol_39.json`, you will find the protocol. The protocol specifies
*how many cubes of sugar should you have with the Dolce Gusto drinks*.

# Roadmap

Code 39 is still in the early stages of development. This is the
projects roadmap:
- Wrap the protocol in an NPM package so code 39 is available through your
terminal
- Modularize the protocol
- Include more drinks
- Integrate with Protocol Code 45 (counts the consumption of coffee)
